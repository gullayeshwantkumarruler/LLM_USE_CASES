    "As a Gen AI Data Scientist at InnoviTech Solutions, the objective is to develop an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based system tailored for the Global Nutrition Health Organization. This system is designed to support users by streamlining the extraction and integration of vital nutritional information from extensive resources, such as the Nutritional Medical Reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application aims to enable healthcare providers to quickly access information regarding symptoms, diagnoses, treatment plans, and more, thereby reducing the need for lengthy manual searches. The RAG-based chatbot will be built with a custom advanced workflow that includes the following key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Expansion:** Enhancing user queries to improve retrieval accuracy without altering the original intent. This step ensures that the user's queries are refined to capture the most relevant information from the extensive nutritional resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Retrieval:** Fetching relevant documents from a vector store based on the expanded or original query. This step is crucial to provide contextually relevant information that the model can use to generate accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Response Generation:** Crafting accurate and informative responses strictly adhering to the retrieved context. This ensures that the AI provides information directly from the trusted nutritional sources, maintaining reliability and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Groundedness Evaluation:** Assessing the factual alignment of the generated response with the retrieved context. This step ensures that the responses generated by the AI are factually correct and based on the provided context, enhancing the credibility of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision Evaluation:** Scoring the precision of the response in addressing the user's query. This step evaluates how well the response addresses the specific query of the user, ensuring relevance and usefulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Response Refinement:** Providing constructive feedback to improve gaps, ambiguities, or missing details in the response. If the response does not meet the groundedness or precision criteria, it is refined to ensure it meets the required standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Refinement:** Suggesting improvements for the expanded query to enhance search precision. If the response needs further improvement, the query itself is refined to ensure better retrieval in subsequent iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these operations is to ensure that the AI provides the best possible response from the context provided, strictly adhering to the nutritional disorder manuals. By performing these operations, we ensure that the responses are both accurate and relevant, meeting the high standards expected in healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow diagram, included below, visually represents this advanced workflow, highlighting the iterative process of grounding, precision checking, and refinement to achieve the most accurate and useful responses:"

    "In this section, we lay the groundwork for the AI Nutrition Disorder Specialist bot by meticulously parsing and preparing data from various nutritional disorder documents. We begin by installing and importing the necessary libraries, followed by unzipping the documents and setting up configurations for OpenAI and Azure models. Next, we parse PDF content using LlamaParse to extract tables and validate parsed JSON objects. We then perform semantic chunking of text for structured retrieval, and generate hypothetical questions and metadata for these text chunks and tables. Finally, we store everything in ChromaDB, ensuring efficient retrieval and processing of relevant information for the bot's responses. This structured approach equips the AI with the ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries related to nutritional disorders."

Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes* for Some Macronutrients, Food and Nutrition\\n Board, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies]\\n Micronutrients\\n Vitamins and minerals required in minute amounts (trace minerals) are micronutrients (see Chs. 4 and 5).\\n Water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and 8 members of the vitamin B complex: biotin,\\n folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin (vitamin B1), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and\\n vitamin B12 (cobalamin).\\n Fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A (retinol), D (cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol), E (\\u03b1-tocopherol), and\\n K (phylloquinone and menaquinone).\\n Only vitamins A, E, and B12 are stored to any significant extent in the body; the other vitamins must be\\n consumed regularly to maintain tissue health.\\n Essential trace minerals include chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium,\\n and zinc. Except for chromium, each of these is incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in\\n metabolism. Except for deficiencies of iron and zinc, micromineral deficiencies are uncommon in\\n developed countries (see Ch. 5).\\n Other minerals (eg, aluminum, arsenic, boron, cobalt, fluoride, nickel, silicon, vanadium) have not been\\n proved essential for people. Fluoride, although not essential, helps prevent tooth decay by forming a\\n compound with Ca (CaF2), which stabilizes the mineral matrix in teeth.\\n All trace minerals are toxic at high levels, and some (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may cause cancer.\\n Other Dietary Substances\\n The daily human diet typically contains as many as 100,000 chemicals (eg, coffee contains 1000). Of\\n these, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are\\n useful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the\\n production and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals,\\n many other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\\n Fiber: Fiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It increases GI motility,\\n prevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination\\n of cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence\\n suggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in\\n patients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber\\n (present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood\\n glucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\\n The typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat\\n flour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming\\n more vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high\\n fiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\\n Nutritional Requirements\\n Good nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical\\n and mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body\\n weight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see Table 1-4), and metabolic and physical\\n activity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more\\n than needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year.

Of these, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are useful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the production and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals, many other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\\n\\n# Fiber\\n\\nFiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It increases GI motility, prevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination of cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence suggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in patients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber (present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood glucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\\n\\nThe typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat flour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming more vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high fiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\\n\\n# Nutritional Requirements\\n\\nGood nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical and mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body weight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see Table 1-4), and metabolic and physical activity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more than needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year. If energy intake is less than expenditure, weight is lost.\",\n",

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n Daily dietary requirements for essential nutrients also depend on age, sex, weight, and metabolic and\\n physical activity. Every 5 yr, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences/National\\n Research Council and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues the dietary reference intakes\\n (DRIs) for protein, energy, and some vitamins and minerals (see Tables 1-4,\\n 4-1, and 5-2). For vitamins and minerals about which less is known, safe and adequate daily dietary\\n intakes are estimated.\\n Pregnant women (see p. 2608) and infants (see p. 2703) have special nutritional needs.\\n The USDA publishes the Food Guide Pyramid, which specifies the number of recommended daily\\n servings of various food groups.

Nutrition: General Considerations\\n Evaluating general nutritional status includes history, physical examination, and sometimes tests. If\\n undernutrition is suspected, laboratory tests (eg, albumin levels) and skin tests for delayed\\n hypersensitivity may be done (see p.\\n 13). Body composition analysis (eg, skinfold measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis) is used to\\n estimate percentage of body fat and to evaluate obesity (see p. 58).\\n History includes questions about dietary intake, weight change, and risk factors for nutritional deficiencies\\n and a focused review of systems (see\\n Table 2-1 on p. 11). A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods\\n eaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods\\n eaten. The weighed ad libitum diet, in which the patient weighs and writes down all foods consumed, is\\n the most accurate record.\\n A complete physical examination, including measurement of height and weight and distribution of body\\n fat, should be done. Body mass index (BMI)\\u2014weight(kg)/height(m)2, which adjusts weight for height (see\\n Table 6-2 on p. 59), is more accurate than height and weight tables. There are standards for growth and\\n weight gain in infants, children, and adolescents (see p. 2756).\\n Distribution of body fat is important. Disproportionate truncal obesity (ie, waist/hip ratio > 0.8) is\\n associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus more\\n often than fat located elsewhere.

Undernutrition\\n Introduction\\n Undernutrition is a form of malnutrition. (Malnutrition also includes overnutrition\\u2014see Ch. 6).\\n Undernutrition can result from inadequate ingestion of nutrients, malabsorption, impaired\\n metabolism, loss of nutrients due to diarrhea, or increased nutritional requirements (as occurs\\n in cancer or infection). Undernutrition progresses in stages; each stage usually takes\\n considerable time to develop. First, nutrient levels in blood and tissues change, followed by\\n intracellular changes in biochemical functions and structure. Ultimately, symptoms and signs\\n appear.\\n Risk Factors\\n Undernutrition is associated with many disorders and circumstances, including poverty and social\\n deprivation. Risk is also greater at certain times (ie, during infancy, early childhood, adolescence,\\n pregnancy, breastfeeding, and old age).\\n Infancy and childhood: Infants and children are particularly susceptible to undernutrition because of\\n their high demand for energy and essential nutrients. Because vitamin K does not readily cross the\\n placenta, neonates may be deficient, so all are given a single injection of vitamin K within 1 h of birth to\\n prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, a life-threatening disorder (see pp. 46 and\\n 2783). Infants fed only breast milk, which is typically low in vitamin D, are given supplemental vitamin D;\\n they can develop vitamin B12 deficiency if the mother is a vegan. Inadequately fed infants and children\\n are at risk of protein-energy undernutrition (PEU\\u2014previously called protein-energy malnutrition) and\\n deficiencies of iron, folate (folic acid), vitamins A and C, copper, and zinc. During adolescence, nutritional\\n requirements increase because the growth rate accelerates. Anorexia nervosa (see p. 1535) may affect\\n adolescent girls in particular.\\n Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Requirements for nutrients increase during pregnancy and\\n breastfeeding. Aberrations of diet, including pica (consumption of nonnutritive substances, such as clay\\n and charcoal), may occur during pregnancy. Anemia due to iron deficiency is common, as is anemia due\\n to folate deficiency, especially among women who have taken oral contraceptives. Vitamin D deficiency is\\n common during late pregnancy, predisposing the child to decreased bone mass.\\n Old age: Aging\\u2014even when disease or dietary deficiency is absent\\u2014leads to sarcopenia (progressive\\n loss of lean body mass), starting after age 40 and eventually amounting to a muscle loss of about 10 kg\\n (22 lb) in men and 5 kg (11 lb) in women. Undernutrition contributes to sarcopenia, and sarcopenia\\n accounts for many of the complications of undernutrition (eg, decreased nitrogen balance, increased\\n susceptibility to infections). Causes of sarcopenia include the following:\\n \\u2022 Decreased physical activity\\n \\u2022 Decreased food intake\\n \\u2022 Increased levels of cytokines (particularly interleukin-6)\\n \\u2022 Decreased levels of growth hormone and mechano growth factor (insulin-like growth factor-3)\\n \\u2022 In men, decreasing androgen levels\\n Aging decreases basal metabolic rate (due mainly to decreased fat-free mass), total body weight, height,\\n and skeletal mass; aging increases mean body fat (as a percentage of body weight) to about 30% (from\\n 20%) in men and to 40% (from 27%) in women.\\n From age 20 to 80, food intake decreases, especially in men.

Diminished taste and smell can decrease eating pleasure but usually decrease food intake only slightly. Anorexia may have other causes (eg, loneliness, inability to shop or prepare meals, dementia, some chronic disorders, use of certain drugs). Depression is a common cause. Occasionally, anorexia nervosa (sometimes called anorexia tardive in the elderly), paranoia, or mania interferes with eating. Dental problems limit the ability to chew and subsequently to digest foods. Swallowing difficulties (eg, due to strokes, other neurologic disorders, esophageal candidiasis, or xerostomia) are common. Poverty or functional impairment limits access to nutrients.\\n\\nThe institutionalized elderly are at particular risk of PEU. They are often confused and may be unable to express hunger or preferences for foods. They may be physically unable to feed themselves. Chewing or swallowing may be very slow, making it tedious for another person to feed them enough food.\\n\\nIn the elderly, particularly the institutionalized elderly, inadequate intake and often decreased absorption or synthesis of vitamin D, increased demand for vitamin D, and inadequate exposure to sunshine contribute to osteomalacia (see p. 41).\\n\\nDisorders and medical procedures: Diabetes, some chronic disorders that affect the GI tract, intestinal resection, and certain other GI surgical procedures tend to impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin B12, Ca, and iron. Gluten enteropathy, pancreatic insufficiency, or other disorders can result in malabsorption. Decreased absorption possibly contributes to iron deficiency and osteoporosis. Liver disorders impair storage of vitamins A and B12 and interfere with metabolism of protein and energy sources. Renal insufficiency predisposes to protein, iron, and vitamin D deficiencies. Anorexia causes some patients with cancer or depression and many with AIDS to consume inadequate amounts of food. Infections, trauma, hyperthyroidism, extensive burns, and prolonged fever increase metabolic demands. Any condition that increases cytokines may be accompanied by muscle loss, lipolysis, low albumin levels, and anorexia.\\n\\nVegetarian diets: Iron deficiency can occur in ovo-lacto vegetarians (although such a diet can be compatible with good health). Vegans may develop vitamin B12 deficiency unless they consume yeast extracts or Asian-style fermented foods. Their intake of Ca, iron, and zinc also tends to be low. A fruit-only diet is not recommended because it is deficient in protein, Na, and many micronutrients.\\n\\nFad diets: Some fad diets result in vitamin, mineral, and protein deficiencies; cardiac, renal, and metabolic disorders; and sometimes death. Very low calorie diets (&lt; 400 kcal/day) cannot sustain health for long.\\n\\nDrugs and nutritional supplements: Many drugs (eg, appetite suppressants, digoxin) decrease appetite; others impair nutrient absorption or metabolism.

Less common than marasmus, kwashiorkor tends to be\\n confined to specific parts of the world, such as rural Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific islands. In\\n these areas, staple foods (eg, yams, cassavas, sweet potatoes, green bananas) are low in protein and\\n high in carbohydrates. In kwashiorkor, cell membranes leak, causing extravasation of intravascular fluid\\n and protein, resulting in peripheral edema.\\n Starvation is a complete lack of nutrients. It occasionally occurs when food is available (as in fasting or\\n anorexia nervosa) but usually occurs because food is unavailable (eg, during famine or wilderness\\n exposure).\\n Secondary PEU: This type most commonly results from the following:\\n \\u2022 Disorders that affect GI function: These disorders can interfere with digestion (eg, pancreatic\\n   insufficiency), absorption (eg, enteritis, enteropathy), or lymphatic transport of nutrients (eg,\\n   retroperitoneal fibrosis, Milroy's disease).\\n \\u2022 Wasting disorders: In wasting disorders (eg, AIDS, cancer) and renal failure, catabolism causes cytokine\\n   excess, resulting in undernutrition via anorexia and cachexia (wasting of muscle and fat). End-stage\\n   heart failure can cause cardiac cachexia, a severe form of undernutrition; mortality rate is particularly\\n   high. Factors contributing to cardiac cachexia may include passive hepatic congestion (causing\\n   anorexia), edema of the intestinal tract (impairing absorption), and, in advanced disease, increased O2\\n   requirement due to anaerobic metabolism. Wasting disorders can decrease appetite or impair\\n   metabolism of nutrients.\\n \\u2022 Conditions that increase metabolic demands: These conditions include infections, hyperthyroidism,\\n   pheochromocytoma, other endocrine disorders, burns, trauma, surgery, and other critical illnesses.\\n Pathophysiology\\n The initial metabolic response is decreased metabolic rate. To supply energy, the body first breaks down\\n adipose tissue. However, later when these tissues are depleted, the body may use protein for energy,\\n resulting in a negative nitrogen balance. Visceral organs and muscle are broken down and decrease in\\n weight. Loss of organ weight is greatest in the liver and intestine, intermediate in the heart and kidneys,\\n and least in the nervous system.\\n Symptoms and Signs\\n Symptoms of moderate PEU can be constitutional or involve specific organ systems. Apathy and irritability\\n are common. The patient is weak, and work capacity decreases. Cognition and sometimes\\n consciousness are impaired. Temporary lactose deficiency and achlorhydria develop. Diarrhea is common\\n and can be aggravated by deficiency of intestinal disaccharidases, especially lactase (see p. 157).\\n Gonadal tissues atrophy. PEU can cause amenorrhea in women and loss of libido in men and women.\\n Wasting of fat and muscle is common in all forms of PEU. In adult volunteers who fasted for 30 to 40\\n days, weight loss was marked (25% of initial weight). If starvation is more prolonged, weight loss may\\n reach 50% in adults and possibly more in children.\\n In adults, cachexia is most obvious in areas where prominent fat depots normally exist. Muscles shrink\\n and bones protrude. The skin becomes thin, dry, inelastic, pale, and cold. The hair is dry and falls out\\n easily, becoming sparse. Wound healing is impaired. In elderly patients, risk of hip fractures and pressure\\n (decubitus) ulcers increases.\\n With acute or chronic severe PEU, heart size and cardiac output decrease; pulse slows\\n                                                                                                         63\",\n",

It occasionally occurs when food is available (as in fasting or anorexia nervosa) but usually occurs because food is unavailable (eg, during famine or wilderness exposure).\\n\\n# Secondary PEU\\n\\nThis type most commonly results from the following:\\n\\n- Disorders that affect GI function: These disorders can interfere with digestion (eg, pancreatic insufficiency), absorption (eg, enteritis, enteropathy), or lymphatic transport of nutrients (eg, retroperitoneal fibrosis, Milroy's disease).\\n- Wasting disorders: In wasting disorders (eg, AIDS, cancer) and renal failure, catabolism causes cytokine excess, resulting in undernutrition via anorexia and cachexia (wasting of muscle and fat). End-stage heart failure can cause cardiac cachexia, a severe form of undernutrition; mortality rate is particularly high. Factors contributing to cardiac cachexia may include passive hepatic congestion (causing anorexia), edema of the intestinal tract (impairing absorption), and, in advanced disease, increased O2 requirement due to anaerobic metabolism. Wasting disorders can decrease appetite or impair metabolism of nutrients.\\n- Conditions that increase metabolic demands: These conditions include infections, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, other endocrine disorders, burns, trauma, surgery, and other critical illnesses.\\n\\n# Pathophysiology\\n\\nThe initial metabolic response is decreased metabolic rate. To supply energy, the body first breaks down adipose tissue. However, later when these tissues are depleted, the body may use protein for energy, resulting in a negative nitrogen balance. Visceral organs and muscle are broken down and decrease in weight. Loss of organ weight is greatest in the liver and intestine, intermediate in the heart and kidneys, and least in the nervous system.\\n\\n# Symptoms and Signs\\n\\nSymptoms of moderate PEU can be constitutional or involve specific organ systems. Apathy and irritability are common. The patient is weak, and work capacity decreases. Cognition and sometimes consciousness are impaired. Temporary lactose deficiency and achlorhydria develop. Diarrhea is common and can be aggravated by deficiency of intestinal disaccharidases, especially lactase (see p. 157). Gonadal tissues atrophy. PEU can cause amenorrhea in women and loss of libido in men and women. Wasting of fat and muscle is common in all forms of PEU. In adult volunteers who fasted for 30 to 40 days, weight loss was marked (25% of initial weight). If starvation is more prolonged, weight loss may reach 50% in adults and possibly more in children.\\n\\nIn adults, cachexia is most obvious in areas where prominent fat depots normally exist. Muscles shrink and bones protrude. The skin becomes thin, dry, inelastic, pale, and cold. The hair is dry and falls out easily, becoming sparse. Wound healing is impaired. In elderly patients, risk of hip fractures and pressure (decubitus) ulcers increases.\\n\\nWith acute or chronic severe PEU, heart size and cardiac output decrease; pulse slows.\",\n",

Many other test results may be abnormal: eg, decreased levels of hormones, vitamins, lipids, cholesterol, prealbumin, insulin growth factor-1, fibronectin, and retinol-binding protein. Urinary creatine and methylhistidine levels can be used to gauge the degree of muscle wasting. Because protein catabolism slows, urinary urea level also decreases. These findings rarely affect treatment.\\n\\nLaboratory tests are required to identify causes of suspected secondary PEU. C-reactive protein or soluble interleukin-2 receptor should be measured when the cause of undernutrition is unclear; these measurements can help determine whether there is cytokine excess. Thyroid function tests may also be done.\\n\\nOther laboratory tests can detect associated abnormalities that may require treatment. Serum electrolytes, BUN, glucose, and possibly levels of Ca, Mg, and phosphate should be measured. Levels of serum glucose, electrolytes (especially K, occasionally Na), phosphate, Ca, and Mg are usually low. BUN is often low unless renal failure is present. Metabolic acidosis may be present. CBC is usually obtained; normocytic anemia (usually due to protein deficiency) or microcytic anemia (due to simultaneous iron deficiency) is usually present.\",\n",

Thus, total energy expenditure (TEE) and\\n protein requirements usually are estimated.\\n Energy expenditure: TEE varies based on the patient's weight, activity level, and degree of metabolic\\n stress (metabolic demands); TEE ranges from 25 kcal/kg/day for people who are sedentary and not under\\n stress to about 40 kcal/kg/day for people who are critically ill.

The possible protective role of \\u03b2-carotene, retinol, and retinoids against some epithelial cancers is under study. However, risk of certain cancers may be increased after \\u03b2-carotene supplementation.\\n\\n# Vitamin A Deficiency\\n\\nVitamin A deficiency can result from inadequate intake, fat malabsorption, or liver disorders. Deficiency impairs immunity and hematopoiesis and causes rashes and typical ocular effects (eg, xerophthalmia, night blindness). Diagnosis is based on typical ocular findings and low vitamin A levels. Treatment consists of vitamin A given orally or, if symptoms are severe or malabsorption is the cause, parenterally.\\n\\n# Etiology\\n\\nPrimary vitamin A deficiency is usually caused by prolonged dietary deprivation. It is endemic in areas such as southern and eastern Asia, where rice, devoid of \\u03b2-carotene, is the staple food. Xerophthalmia due to primary deficiency is a common cause of blindness among young children in developing countries.\",\n",

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n Secondary vitamin A deficiency may be due to decreased bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids or to\\n interference with absorption, storage, or transport of vitamin A. Interference with absorption or storage is\\n likely in sprue, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, duodenal bypass, chronic diarrhea, bile duct\\n obstruction, giardiasis, and cirrhosis. Vitamin A deficiency is common in prolonged protein-energy\\n undernutrition not only because the diet is deficient but also because vitamin A storage and transport is\\n defective. In children with complicated measles, vitamin A can shorten the duration of the disorder and\\n reduce the severity of symptoms and risk of death.\\n Symptoms and Signs\\n Impaired dark adaptation of the eyes, which can lead to night blindness, is an early symptom.\\n Xerophthalmia (which is nearly pathognomonic) results from keratinization of the eyes. It involves drying\\n (xerosis) and thickening of the conjunctivae and corneas. Superficial foamy patches composed of\\n epithelial debris and secretions on the exposed bulbar conjunctiva (Bitot's spots) develop. In advanced\\n deficiency, the cornea becomes hazy and can develop erosions, which can lead to its destruction\\n (keratomalacia).\\n Keratinization of the skin and of the mucous membranes in the respiratory, GI, and urinary tracts can\\n occur. Drying, scaling, and follicular thickening of the skin and respiratory infections can result. Immunity\\n is generally impaired.\\n The younger the patient, the more severe are the effects of vitamin A deficiency. Growth retardation and\\n infections are common among children. Mortality rate can exceed 50% in children with severe vitamin A\\n deficiency.\\n Diagnosis\\n \\u2022 Serum retinol levels, clinical evaluation, and response to vitamin A\\n Ocular findings suggest the diagnosis. Dark adaptation can be impaired in other disorders (eg, zinc\\n deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, severe refractive errors, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy). If dark\\n adaptation is impaired, rod scotometry and electroretinography are done to determine whether vitamin A\\n deficiency is the cause.\\n Serum levels of retinol are measured. Normal range is 28 to 86 \\u03bcg/dL (1 to 3 \\u03bcmol/L). However, levels\\n decrease only after the deficiency is advanced because the liver contains large stores of vitamin A. Also,\\n decreased levels may result from acute infection, which causes retinol-binding protein and transthyretin\\n (also called prealbumin) levels to decrease transiently. A therapeutic trial of vitamin A may help confirm\\n the diagnosis.\\n Prevention\\n The diet should include dark green leafy vegetables, deep- or bright-colored fruits (eg, papayas,\\n oranges), carrots, and yellow vegetables (eg, squash, pumpkin).

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n\\nSecondary vitamin A deficiency may be due to decreased bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids or to interference with absorption, storage, or transport of vitamin A. Interference with absorption or storage is likely in sprue, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, duodenal bypass, chronic diarrhea, bile duct obstruction, giardiasis, and cirrhosis.

Xerophthalmia (which is nearly pathognomonic) results from keratinization of the eyes. It involves drying (xerosis) and thickening of the conjunctivae and corneas.

In advanced deficiency, the cornea becomes hazy and can develop erosions, which can lead to its destruction (keratomalacia).\\n\\nKeratinization of the skin and of the mucous membranes in the respiratory, GI, and urinary tracts can occur.

If dark adaptation is impaired, rod scotometry and electroretinography are done to determine whether vitamin A deficiency is the cause.\\n\\nSerum levels of retinol are measured. Normal range is 28 to 86 \\u03bcg/dL (1 to 3 \\u03bcmol/L). However, levels decrease only after the deficiency is advanced because the liver contains large stores of vitamin A. Also, decreased levels may result from acute infection, which causes retinol-binding protein and transthyretin (also called prealbumin) levels to decrease transiently. A therapeutic trial of vitamin A may help confirm the diagnosis.\\n\\n# Prevention\\n\\nThe diet should include dark green leafy vegetables, deep- or bright-colored fruits (eg, papayas, oranges), carrots, and yellow vegetables (eg, squash, pumpkin).

Birth\\n defects occur in children of women receiving isotretinoin (which is related to vitamin A) for acne treatment\\n during pregnancy.\\n Although carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes\\n carotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenodermia,\\n in which the skin becomes yellow. When taken as a supplement, \\u03b2-carotene has been associated with\\n increased cancer risk; risk does not seem to increase when carotenoids are consumed in fruits and\\n vegetables.\\n Symptoms and Signs\\n Although symptoms may vary, headache and rash usually develop during acute or chronic toxicity. Acute\\n toxicity causes increased intracranial pressure. Drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and\\n vomiting are common. Sometimes the skin subsequently peels.\\n Early symptoms of chronic toxicity are sparsely distributed, coarse hair; alopecia of the eyebrows; dry,\\n rough skin; dry eyes; and cracked lips. Later, severe headache, pseudotumor cerebri, and generalized\\n weakness develop. Cortical hyperostosis of bone and arthralgia may occur, especially in children.\\n Fractures may occur easily, especially in the elderly.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n Differentiating vitamin A toxicity from other disorders may be difficult.

Symptoms and signs of chronic toxicity\\n usually disappear within 1 to 4 wk. However, birth defects in the fetus of a mother who has taken\\n megadoses of vitamin A are not reversible.\\n Treatment\\n Vitamin A is stopped.\\n Vitamin B6\\n Vitamin B6 includes a group of closely related compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. They\\n are metabolized in the body to pyridoxal phosphate, which acts as a coenzyme in many important\\n reactions in blood, CNS, and skin metabolism. Vitamin B6 is important in heme and nucleic acid\\n biosynthesis and in lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism.\\n Vitamin B6 Deficiency and Dependency\\n Because vitamin B6 is present in most foods, dietary deficiency is rare. Secondary deficiency\\n may result from various conditions. Symptoms can include peripheral neuropathy, a pellagra-\\n like syndrome, anemia, and seizures, which, particularly in infants, may not resolve when\\n treated with anticonvulsants.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n \\u2022 Usually, skin or gingival findings and risk factors\\n Diagnosis is usually made clinically in a patient who has skin or gingival signs and is at risk of vitamin C\\n deficiency. Laboratory confirmation may be available. Anemia is common. Bleeding, coagulation, and PT\\n are normal.\\n Skeletal x-rays can help diagnose childhood (but not adult) scurvy. Changes are most evident at the ends\\n of long bones, particularly at the knee. Early changes resemble atrophy. Loss of trabeculae results in a\\n ground-glass appearance. The cortex thins. A line of calcified, irregular cartilage (white line of Fraenkel)\\n may be visible at the metaphysis. A zone of rarefaction or a linear fracture proximal and parallel to the\\n white line may be visible as only a triangular defect at the bone's lateral margin but is specific. The\\n epiphysis may be compressed. Healing subperiosteal hemorrhages may elevate and calcify the\\n periosteum.\\n Laboratory diagnosis, which requires measuring blood ascorbic acid, is sometimes done at academic\\n centers. Levels of < 0.6 mg/dL (< 34 \\u03bcmol/L) are considered marginal; levels of < 0.2 mg/dL (< 11 \\u03bcmol/L)\\n indicate vitamin C deficiency. Measurement of ascorbic acid levels in the WBC-platelet layer of\\n centrifuged blood is not widely available or standardized.\\n In adults, scurvy must be differentiated from arthritis, hemorrhagic disorders, gingivitis, and protein-energy\\n undernutrition. Hyperkeratotic hair follicles with surrounding hyperemia or hemorrhage are almost\\n pathognomonic. Bleeding gums, conjunctival hemorrhages, most petechiae, and ecchymoses are\\n nonspecific.\\n Treatment\\n \\u2022 Nutritious diet with supplemental ascorbic acid\\n For scurvy in adults, ascorbic acid 100 to 500 mg po tid is given for 1 to 2 wk, until signs disappear, and\\n followed by a nutritious diet supplying 1 to 2 times the daily recommended intake. In scurvy, therapeutic\\n doses of ascorbic acid restore the functions of vitamin C in a few days. The symptoms and signs usually\\n disappear over 1 to 2 wk. Chronic gingivitis with extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage persists longer.\\n Prevention\\n Vitamin C 75 mg po once/day for women and 90 mg po once/day for men prevents deficiency. Smokers\\n should consume an additional 35 mg/day. Five servings of most fruits and vegetables (recommended\\n daily) provide > 200 mg of vitamin C.\\n Vitamin C Toxicity\\n The upper limit for vitamin C intake is 2000 mg/day. Up to 10 g/day of vitamin C are sometimes taken for\\n unproven health benefits, such as preventing or shortening the duration of viral infections or slowing or\\n reversing the progression of cancer or atherosclerosis. Such doses may acidify the urine, cause nausea\\n and diarrhea, interfere with the healthy antioxidant-prooxidant balance in the body, and, in patients with\\n thalassemia or hemochromatosis, promote iron overload. Intake below the upper limit does not have toxic\\n effects in healthy adults.\\n Vitamin D\\n Vitamin D has 2 main forms: D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol); the latter is the naturally\\n occurring form and the form used for low-dose supplementation. Vitamin D3 is synthesized in skin by\\n exposure to direct sunlight (ultraviolet B radiation) and obtained in the diet chiefly in fish liver oils and salt\\n water fish. In some developed countries, milk and other foods are fortified with vitamin D. Human breast\\n milk is low in vitamin D, containing an average of only 10% of the amount in fortified cow's milk.\\n Requirements for vitamin D increase with age because skin synthesis declines.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency & Toxicity\\n Vitamin D is a prohormone with several active metabolites that act as hormones. Vitamin D is metabolized\\n by the liver to 25(OH)D, which is then converted by the kidneys to 1,25(OH)2D (1,25-\\n dihydroxycholecalciferol, calcitriol, or active vitamin D hormone). 25(OH)D, the major circulating form, has\\n some metabolic activity, but 1,25(OH)2D is the most metabolically active. The conversion to 1,25(OH)2D\\n is regulated by its own concentration, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and serum concentrations of Ca and\\n phosphate.\\n [\\n Table 4-6. Actions of Vitamin D and its Metabolites]\\n Vitamin D affects many organ systems (see Table 4-6), but mainly it increases Ca and phosphate\\n absorption from the intestine and promotes normal bone formation and mineralization. Vitamin D and\\n related analogs may be used to treat psoriasis, hypoparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and possibly\\n leukemia and breast, prostate, and colon cancers; they may also be used for immunosuppression.\\n Vitamin D Deficiency and Dependency\\n Inadequate exposure to sunlight predisposes to vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency impairs bone\\n mineralization, causing rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults and possibly contributing\\n to osteoporosis. Treatment usually consists of oral vitamin D; Ca and phosphate are\\n supplemented as needed. Prevention is often possible. Rarely, hereditary disorders cause\\n impaired metabolism of vitamin D (dependency).\\n Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of rickets and osteomalacia, but these disorders may also result\\n from other conditions, such as various renal tubular disorders, familial hypophosphatemic (vitamin D-\\n resistant) rickets (see p. 2991), chronic metabolic acidosis, hypoparathyroidism (which reduces vitamin D\\n absorption), inadequate dietary Ca, and disorders or drugs that impair the mineralization of bone matrix.\\n Vitamin D deficiency causes hypocalcemia, which stimulates production of PTH, causing\\n hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism increases absorption, bone mobilization, and renal\\n conservation of Ca but increases excretion of phosphate. As a result, the serum level of Ca may be\\n normal, but because of hypophosphatemia, bone mineralization is impaired.\\n Etiology\\n Vitamin D deficiency may result from the following.\\n Inadequate exposure or intake: Inadequate direct sunlight exposure (or sunscreen use) and\\n inadequate intake usually occur simultaneously to result in clinical deficiency.

Mineral Deficiency and Toxicity\\n Introduction\\n Six macrominerals are required by people in gram amounts. Four (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) are cations; two (Cl\\n and P) are accompanying anions (see p. 820). Daily requirements range from 0.3 to 2.0 g. Bone, muscle,\\n heart, and brain function depend on these minerals.\\n Nine trace minerals (microminerals) are required by people in minute amounts: chromium, copper, iodine,\\n iron, fluorine, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc. (For sources, functions, effects of deficiency\\n and toxicity, and dietary requirements, see\\n Tables 5-1 and\\n 5-2.) All trace minerals are toxic at high levels; some minerals (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may be\\n carcinogens.\\n Mineral deficiencies (except of iodine, iron, and zinc) do not often develop spontaneously in adults on\\n ordinary diets; infants are more vulnerable because their growth is rapid and intake varies. Trace mineral\\n imbalances can result from hereditary disorders (eg, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease), kidney dialysis,\\n parenteral nutrition, or restrictive diets prescribed for people with inborn errors of metabolism.\\n Chromium\\n Only 1 to 3% of biologically active trivalent chromium (Cr) is absorbed. Normal plasma levels are 0.05 to\\n 0.50 \\u03bcg/L (1.0 to 9.6 nmol/L). Chromium potentiates insulin activity and increases the growth rate in\\n undernourished children. Supplements do not enhance muscle size or strength in men.\\n Deficiency: Four patients receiving long-term TPN developed possible chromium deficiency, with\\n glucose intolerance, weight loss, ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms resolved in 3 who were\\n given trivalent chromium 150 to 250 mg.\\n Toxicity: High doses of trivalent chromium given parenterally cause skin irritation, but lower doses given\\n orally are not toxic. Exposure to hexavalent chromium (CrO3) in the workplace may irritate the skin, lungs,\\n and GI tract and may cause perforation of the nasal septum and lung carcinoma.\\n Copper\\n Copper is a component of many body proteins; almost all of the body's copper is bound to copper\\n proteins. Unbound (free) copper ions are toxic. Genetic mechanisms control the incorporation of copper\\n into apoproteins and the processes that prevent toxic accumulation of copper in the body. Copper\\n absorbed in excess of metabolic requirements is excreted through bile.\\n [Table 5-1. Trace Minerals]\\n Acquired Copper Deficiency\\n If the genetic mechanisms controlling copper metabolism are normal, dietary deficiency rarely causes\\n clinically significant copper deficiency. The only reported causes are kwashiorkor, persistent infantile\\n diarrhea (usually associated with a diet limited to milk), severe malabsorption (as in sprue), and excessive\\n zinc intake.\\n Deficiency may cause neutropenia, impaired bone calcification, and hypochromic anemia not responsive\\n to iron supplements.\\n Diagnosis is based on low serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin, although these tests are not always\\n reliable.

The impaired transport decreases copper secretion into the\\n bile, thus causing the copper overload and resultant accumulation in the liver, which begins at birth. The\\n impaired transport also interferes with incorporation of copper into the copper protein ceruloplasmin, thus\\n decreasing serum levels of ceruloplasmin.\\n Hepatic fibrosis develops, ultimately causing cirrhosis.

It can also be low in heterozygous carriers and those with other liver disorders (eg, viral\\n hepatitis, drug- or alcohol-induced liver disease). A low ceruloplasmin level in a patient with a Kayser-\\n Fleischer ring is diagnostic.

If serum ceruloplasmin is low and urinary copper excretion is high, diagnosis is\\n clear.

However, false-negative results may occur because of a sampling error\\n (due to large variations in copper concentrations in the liver) or fulminant hepatitis (causing necrosis that\\n releases large amounts of copper).\\n Screening: Because early treatment is most effective, screening is indicated for anyone who has a\\n sibling, cousin, or parent with Wilson's disease. Screening consists of a slit-lamp examination and\\n measurement of transaminase levels, serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and 24-h urine copper excretion.\\n If any results are abnormal, liver biopsy is done to measure hepatic copper concentration.

Mineral Deficiency & Toxicity\\n Iodine Deficiency\\n Deficiency is rare in areas where iodized salt is used but common worldwide. Iodine deficiency develops\\n when iodide intake is < 20 \\u03bcg/day. In mild or moderate deficiency, the thyroid gland, influenced by thyroid-\\n stimulating hormone (TSH), hypertrophies to concentrate iodide in itself, resulting in colloid goiter.\\n Usually, patients remain euthyroid; however, severe iodine deficiency in adults may cause hypothyroidism\\n (endemic myxedema). It can decrease fertility and increase risk of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and\\n prenatal and infant mortality. Severe maternal iodine deficiency retards fetal growth and brain\\n development, sometimes resulting in birth defects, and, in infants, causes cretinism, which may include\\n intellectual disability, deaf-mutism, difficulty walking, short stature, and sometimes hypothyroidism.\\n Diagnosis\\n \\u2022 Assessment of thyroid structure and function\\n Diagnosis in adults and children is usually based on thyroid function, examination for goiter, and imaging\\n tests identifying abnormalities in thyroid function and structure (see p.\\n 776). All neonates should be screened by measuring the TSH level.\\n Treatment\\n \\u2022 Iodide with or without levothyroxine\\n Infants with iodine deficiency are given L-thyroxine 3 \\u03bcg/kg po once/day for a week plus iodide 50 to 90\\n \\u03bcg po once/day for several weeks to quickly restore a euthyroid state. Children are treated with iodide 90\\n to 120 \\u03bcg once/day. Adults are given iodide 150 \\u03bcg once/day. Iodine deficiency can also be treated by\\n giving levothyroxine. Serum TSH levels are monitored in all patients until the levels are normal (ie, < 5\\n \\u03bcIU/mL).\\n Iodine Toxicity\\n Chronic toxicity may develop when intake is > 1.1 mg/day. Most people who ingest excess amounts of\\n iodine remain euthyroid. Some people who ingest excess amounts of iodine, particularly those who were\\n previously deficient, develop hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Paradoxically, excess uptake\\n of iodine by the thyroid may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (called Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Thus, iodine\\n toxicity can eventually cause iodide goiter, hypothyroidism, or myxedema. Very large amounts of iodide\\n may cause a brassy taste in the mouth, increased salivation, GI irritation, and acneiform skin lesions.\\n Patients exposed to frequent large amounts of radiographic contrast dyes or the drug amiodarone also\\n need to have their thyroid function monitored.\\n Diagnosis is usually based on thyroid function and imaging test findings (see p. 776), which are\\n correlated with clinical data. Iodine excretion may be more specific but is not usually measured. Treatment\\n consists of correcting thyroid abnormalities and, if intake is excessive, dietary modification.\\n Iron\\n Iron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body. Heme iron, contained\\n mainly in animal products, is absorbed much better than nonheme iron (eg, in plants and grains), which\\n accounts for > 85% of iron in the average diet. However, absorption of nonheme iron is increased when it\\n is consumed with animal protein and vitamin C.\\n Deficiency: Iron deficiency is one of the most common mineral deficiencies in the world. It may result\\n from the following:\\n \\u2022 Inadequate iron intake, common in infants, adolescent girls, and pregnant women\\n \\u2022 Malabsorption (eg, celiac sprue)\\n                                                                                                       104\",\n",

Paradoxically, excess uptake of iodine by the thyroid may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (called Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Thus, iodine toxicity can eventually cause iodide goiter, hypothyroidism, or myxedema. Very large amounts of iodide may cause a brassy taste in the mouth, increased salivation, GI irritation, and acneiform skin lesions. Patients exposed to frequent large amounts of radiographic contrast dyes or the drug amiodarone also need to have their thyroid function monitored.\\n\\nDiagnosis is usually based on thyroid function and imaging test findings (see p. 776), which are correlated with clinical data. Iodine excretion may be more specific but is not usually measured. Treatment consists of correcting thyroid abnormalities and, if intake is excessive, dietary modification.\\n\\n# Iron\\n\\nIron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body. Heme iron, contained mainly in animal products, is absorbed much better than nonheme iron (eg, in plants and grains), which accounts for &gt; 85% of iron in the average diet. However, absorption of nonheme iron is increased when it is consumed with animal protein and vitamin C.\\n\\n# Deficiency\\n\\nIron deficiency is one of the most common mineral deficiencies in the world. It may result from the following:\\n\\n- Inadequate iron intake, common in infants, adolescent girls, and pregnant women\\n- Malabsorption (eg, celiac sprue)\",\n",

Laboratory tests\\n showed high levels of sulfite and xanthine and low levels of sulfate and uric acid in the blood and urine.\\n Ammonium molybdate 300 \\u03bcg/day IV caused dramatic recovery.\\n A case of molybdenum toxicity may have occurred in 1961; it caused goutlike symptoms and\\n abnormalities of the GI tract, liver, and kidneys.\\n Selenium\\n Selenium (Se) is a part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which metabolizes hydro-peroxides formed\\n from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Selenium is also a part of the enzymes that deiodinate thyroid\\n hormones. Generally, selenium acts as an antioxidant that works with vitamin E. Some epidemiologic\\n studies associate low selenium levels with cancer. In children with Down syndrome, selenium\\n supplements may help prevent bacterial infections. Plasma levels vary from 8 to 25 \\u03bcg/dL, depending on\\n selenium intake. Diagnosis is usually clinical; sometimes blood glutathione peroxidase is measured.\\n Deficiency: Deficiency is rare, even in New Zealand and Finland, where selenium intake is 30 to 50\\n \\u03bcg/day, compared with 100 to 250 \\u03bcg/day in the US and Canada. In certain areas of China, where intake\\n averages 10 to 15 \\u03bcg/day, selenium deficiency predisposes patients to Keshan disease, an endemic viral\\n cardiomyopathy affecting primarily children and young women. This cardiomyopathy can be prevented\\n but not cured by sodium selenite supplements of 50 \\u03bcg/day po. Patients receiving long-term TPN have\\n developed selenium deficiency with muscle pain and tenderness that responded to a selenomethionine\\n supplement. In Siberian Russia and China, growing children with selenium deficiency may develop\\n chronic osteoarthropathy (Kashin-Beck disease). Selenium deficiency may contribute synergistically with\\n iodine deficiency to the development of goiter and hypothyroidism.\\n Diagnosis is made clinically or sometimes by measuring glutathione peroxidase activity or plasma\\n selenium, but neither of these tests is readily available. Treatment consists of sodium selenite 100 \\u03bcg/day\\n po.\\n Toxicity: At high doses (> 900 \\u03bcg/day), selenium causes toxicity. Manifestations include hair loss,\\n abnormal nails, dermatitis, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, irritability, and a garlic odor of\\n the breath. Toxic levels of plasma selenium are not well defined.\\n Zinc\\n Zinc (Zn) is contained mainly in bones, teeth, hair, skin, liver, muscle, leukocytes, and testes. Zinc is a\\n component of several hundred enzymes, including many nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)\\n dehydrogenases, RNA and DNA polymerases, and DNA transcription factors as well as alkaline\\n phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, and carbonic anhydrase. A diet high in fiber and phytate (eg, in\\n whole-grain bread) reduces zinc absorption.\\n Deficiency: Dietary deficiency is unlikely in healthy people. Secondary zinc deficiency can develop in the\\n following:\\n \\u2022 Some patients with hepatic insufficiency (because the ability to retain zinc is lost)\\n \\u2022 Patients taking diuretics\\n \\u2022 Patients with diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, or malabsorption\\n \\u2022 Patients with stressful conditions (eg, sepsis, burns, head injury)\\n \\u2022 Elderly institutionalized and homebound patients (common)\\n Maternal zinc deficiency may cause fetal malformations and low birth weight.\\n                                                                                                     106\",\n",

Selenium is also a part of the enzymes that deiodinate thyroid hormones. Generally, selenium acts as an antioxidant that works with vitamin E. Some epidemiologic studies associate low selenium levels with cancer. In children with Down syndrome, selenium supplements may help prevent bacterial infections. Plasma levels vary from 8 to 25 \\u03bcg/dL, depending on selenium intake. Diagnosis is usually clinical; sometimes blood glutathione peroxidase is measured.\\n\\n# Deficiency\\n\\nDeficiency is rare, even in New Zealand and Finland, where selenium intake is 30 to 50 \\u03bcg/day, compared with 100 to 250 \\u03bcg/day in the US and Canada. In certain areas of China, where intake averages 10 to 15 \\u03bcg/day, selenium deficiency predisposes patients to Keshan disease, an endemic viral cardiomyopathy affecting primarily children and young women. This cardiomyopathy can be prevented but not cured by sodium selenite supplements of 50 \\u03bcg/day po. Patients receiving long-term TPN have developed selenium deficiency with muscle pain and tenderness that responded to a selenomethionine supplement. In Siberian Russia and China, growing children with selenium deficiency may develop chronic osteoarthropathy (Kashin-Beck disease). Selenium deficiency may contribute synergistically with iodine deficiency to the development of goiter and hypothyroidism. Diagnosis is made clinically or sometimes by measuring glutathione peroxidase activity or plasma selenium, but neither of these tests is readily available. Treatment consists of sodium selenite 100 \\u03bcg/day po.\\n\\n# Toxicity\\n\\nAt high doses (> 900 \\u03bcg/day), selenium causes toxicity. Manifestations include hair loss, abnormal nails, dermatitis, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, irritability, and a garlic odor of the breath. Toxic levels of plasma selenium are not well defined.\\n\\n# Zinc\\n\\nZinc (Zn) is contained mainly in bones, teeth, hair, skin, liver, muscle, leukocytes, and testes. Zinc is a component of several hundred enzymes, including many nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenases, RNA and DNA polymerases, and DNA transcription factors as well as alkaline phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, and carbonic anhydrase. A diet high in fiber and phytate (eg, in whole-grain bread) reduces zinc absorption.\\n\\n# Deficiency\\n\\nDietary deficiency is unlikely in healthy people. Secondary zinc deficiency can develop in the following:\\n\\n- Some patients with hepatic insufficiency (because the ability to retain zinc is lost)\\n- Patients taking diuretics\\n- Patients with diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, or malabsorption\\n- Patients with stressful conditions (eg, sepsis, burns, head injury)\\n- Elderly institutionalized and homebound patients (common)\\n\\nMaternal zinc deficiency may cause fetal malformations and low birth weight.\",\n",

Genetic factors may affect the many signaling\\n molecules and receptors used by parts of the hypothalamus and GI tract to regulate food intake (see\\n Sidebar 6-1). Rarely, obesity results from abnormal levels of peptides that regulate food intake (eg, leptin)\\n or abnormalities in their receptors (eg, melanocortin-4 receptor).\\n Genetic factors also regulate energy expenditure, including BMR, diet-induced thermogenesis, and\\n nonvoluntary activity-associated thermogenesis. Genetic factors may have a greater effect on the\\n distribution of body fat, particularly abdominal fat (see Metabolic Syndrome on p. 64), than on the amount\\n of body fat.\\n Environmental factors: Weight is gained when caloric intake exceeds energy needs. Important\\n determinants of energy intake include portion sizes and the energy density of the food. High-fat foods,\\n processed foods, and diets high in refined carbohydrates, soft drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol promote\\n weight gain. Diets high in fresh fruit and vegetables, fiber, and complex carbohydrates, with water as the\\n main fluid consumed, minimize weight gain. A sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain.\\n Regulatory factors: Prenatal maternal obesity, prenatal maternal smoking, intrauterine growth\\n restriction, and insufficient sleep can disturb weight regulation. About 15% of women permanently gain \\u2265\\n 20 lb with each pregnancy.

Genetic factors:\\n Heritability of BMI is about 66%. Genetic factors may affect the many signaling\\nmolecules and receptors used by parts of the hypothalamus and GI tract to regulate food intake (see\\nSidebar 6-1\\n). Rarely, obesity results from abnormal levels of peptides that regulate food intake (eg, leptin)\\nor abnormalities in their receptors (eg, melanocortin-4 receptor).

    "In this section, we focus on developing an intelligent Nutrition Disorder Specialist agent that can provide accurate and context-aware responses. We start by building an Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent Tool, which involves importing necessary libraries, defining the agent's state, expanding queries for better retrieval, and fetching relevant information from the vector store. We then generate responses based on the retrieved context and evaluate their groundedness and precision. If needed, we refine the responses and queries to ensure high-quality outputs. Additionally, we guardrail user input using Llama Guard to ensure safe interactions. Finally, we initialize and run the AI Nutrition Disorder Specialist agent, enabling it to answer nutrition disorder-related questions effectively and safely. This comprehensive setup equips the agent with advanced retrieval mechanisms and ensures safe and informative user interactions."

Many medical centers have multi-disciplinary nutrition support teams of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and\\npharmacists to help the clinician prevent, diagnose, and treat occult nutritional deficiencies. Overnutrition may contribute to chronic disorders, such as cancer, hypertension, obesity, diabetes\\nmellitus, and coronary artery disease. Dietary restrictions are necessary in many hereditary metabolic\\ndisorders (eg, galactosemia, phenylketonuria). Evaluation of Nutritional Status\\nIndications for nutritional evaluation include undesirable body weight or body composition, suspicion of\\nspecific deficiencies or toxicities\\n[\\nTable 1-5. Recommended Dietary Intake for 40-yr-Olds with Moderate Physical Activity*]\\nof essential nutrients, and, in infants and children, insufficient growth or development.

We begin by setting up the environment and fetching necessary API keys and secrets. We then reuse the functions and workflow definitions from the previous section to create the LangGraph agent. The advanced RAG function is run to handle user queries and generate responses, leveraging context-aware interactions. We create a user-friendly interface for the agent using Streamlit, ensuring a seamless user experience. The final step involves deploying the agent on Hugging Face Docker Spaces using Docker. This includes creating a Dockerfile, uploading necessary files, and initiating the deployment process.
